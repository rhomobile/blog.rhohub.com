We were excited to read about the BlackBerry WebWorks Application Platform which was released yesterday. It is yet more validation of the “use your web skills to write native smartphone apps” approach that Rhomobile invented two years ago.

For developers that want to target all smartphones (not just BlackBerry), or provide synchronized offline data, or get the power of the Model View Controller pattern (WebWorks and other frameworks do not allow separation of controllers and views) we believe that the existence of such simpler frameworks provides a great steppingstone to Rhodes.
