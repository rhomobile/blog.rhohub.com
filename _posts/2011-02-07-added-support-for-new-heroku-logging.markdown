[{{ page.title }}]({{ page.url }})
==================================

Today we added support for [Heroku's](http://heroku.com/) [advanced logging](http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/2/3/new_logging_now_in_general_availability/).  All new and existing [RhoSync](http://rhomobile.com/products/rhosync) applications can take advantage of the advanced logging system automatically.  Just deploy your RhoSync app if it isn't deployed already and click on the "Heroku Logs" button:

This will bring up a window showing the log output of your RhoSync application:
