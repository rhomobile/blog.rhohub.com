[{{ page.title }}]({{ page.url }})
==================================

We just pushed up support for IE 8 and IE 9 beta, so if you're an IE user we encourage you to give it a try.  Now on Windows you can use RhoHub with any major browser (IE, Firefox, Chrome, Safari).  In addition to the recently added [iOS build support](http://blog.rhohub.com/2010/09/30/rhohub-adds-iphone-ipad-build-capability.html), we hope this makes your RhoHub Windows experience more comfortable.  As always please [send us feedback](mailto:support@rhohub.com) if you like.
