==================================

Today we are happy to announce support for building from Github in Rhomobile!

Users can now build their Rhomobile applications using their Github repositories. This works for both public Github repositories, and even private Github repositories (note: a few extra steps are required for private repositories). Building from your public or private Github repositories provides a more reliable build experience. 

We hope you enjoy the benefits of this new capability.
