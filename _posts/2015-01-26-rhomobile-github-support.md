==================================

Today we are happy to announce support for building from Github in Rhomobile!

Users should now be able to build their Rhomobile applications using their Github repositories. This works for both public Github repositories, and even private Github repositories (note: a few extra steps are required for private repositories). We really hope this decreases the uncertainty of using Rhomobile and helps users build more reliably. 

We hope you enjoy the benefits of this new capability.
