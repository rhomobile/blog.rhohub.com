==================================

When we [launched the RhoHub editor last year](http://blog.rhohub.com/2011/03/26/introducing-rhohub-editor.html), we wanted to provide a simple way for developers to write Rhodes / RhoConnect applications in the browser.  Since then we launched [RhoMobile Suite](http://www.motorola.com/Business/US-EN/Business+Product+and+Services/Software+and+Applications/RhoMobile+Suite), a complete HTML5 development platform based on the Eclipse Platform.

We will remove the RhoHub editor **December 1st** and instead focus on making RhoMobile Suite integrate with RhoHub to give you the best experience.  More details on this integration are coming soon!

RhoMobile Suite comes with the Eclipse Git plugin pre-installed so you can still access all of your existing RhoHub applications and collaborate with your team.  We encourage you to [try it](http://www.motorola.com/Business/US-EN/Business+Product+and+Services/Software+and+Applications/RhoMobile+Suite) if you haven't already.
