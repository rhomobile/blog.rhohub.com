==================================

We are excited to announce the launch of RhoHub 3.0 including a new HTML5 project editor complete with a git interface!  The editor is still in beta as we work out all the bugs, so please let us know what you think!  Currently the editor supports:

* Editing Ruby/HTML/CSS/JavaScript files
* Viewing image files
* Uploading of local files into the editor
* Adding, removing, renaming of files and directories
* Git commit and reset actions to files
* Building your Rhodes app and deploying your RhoSync app right from the editor!
