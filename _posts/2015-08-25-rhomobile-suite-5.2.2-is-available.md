==================================

What is new in this release:

* RhoMobile Suite 5.2.2 features a completely redesigned licensing model.
	* From 5.2.2 you no longer purchase licenses to run on a specific device or that are tied to a specific application, instead licenses are purchased on a per-developer basis and integrated with the re-branded [Rhomobile.com](http://rhomobile.com/) website, the Rho cloud build solution.
	* Full details of the new license model are available from our [licensing doc](http://docs.rhomobile.com/en/edge/guide/licensing) which is definitely worth a quick read before getting started with 5.2.2.
	* **You will need a developer account before you can start building your applications with 5.2.**
* Relaunch of our cloud build solution.
	* A complete redesign of our cloud build offering, now branded [Rhomobile.com](http://rhomobile.com/).
	* RhoMobileSuite 4.x builds can now be executed in the cloud.
	* Integration with RhoStudio and our new license model gives seamless transition between cloud building and building locally on your machine.
	* Performance enhancements to our cloud build will greatly decrease the length of time required to build most applications.
* Runtime and startup performance improvements; you should notice an improvement in application performance when using applications built in RhoMobile Suite 5.2.2, particularly on Windows Mobile / CE.
* We continue our beta support for Motorola Solutions' 'SimulScan' product.
* Support for a new device: MC32N0 CE7.0. Support for the Android variant of that platform will be available closer to that product launch.
* New common API for [AudioCapture](http://docs.rhomobile.com/en/5.2.2/api/audiocapture).
* Support for Android KitKat consumer devices. Support for Motorola Solutions' KitKat devices will be available closer to those product launches.
* Additional bug fixes.
