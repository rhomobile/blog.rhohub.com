[{{ page.title }}]({{ page.url }})
==================================

As you may have already noticed, we made some signifcant changes to the RhoHub interface yesterday.  Most of the site is now using twitter bootstrap and we've made several enhancements to make pages load faster.

## Project Tabs

Projects are now organized with a tab layout allowing more space for information.

## More Info

Help on the site is now easier to find with the "Help" and "More Info" buttons.
