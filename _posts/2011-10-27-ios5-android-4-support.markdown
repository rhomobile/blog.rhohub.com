==================================

We're happy to announce [iOS 5](http://www.apple.com/ios/) and Android 4.0 [Ice Cream Sandwich](http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-4.0-highlights.html) support in the RhoHub build service.  We've also updated the default version of rhodes 3.2 so now your applications will build on the latest Rhodes and OS versions available.

Cheers!
