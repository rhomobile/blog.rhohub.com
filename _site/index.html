		modern development goodness for native apps The explosion of smartphone app development and usage is a great thing for programmers and users alike. People are productive and entertained in so many more places and situations than they ever were. But as exciting as new smartphones and their apps are, developing for them is like going back three decades in computer science. I remember complaining about the awkwardness of Objective C in the early 80s (almost thirty years ago). It isn’t just iPhone developers who have to suffer with antiquated approaches to software development. Android developers work with Google’s own strange J2ME superset/J2SE subset, created just for Android. As powerful as Android devices are now, the need to not just standardize on J2SE is very dubious (J2SE is certainly not too big for today’s Android). BlackBerry also introduces their own strange superset of J2ME for phones. And it is notoriously difficult to install and develop for. Both environments feature painfully slow emulators that are so cumbersome that most developers just dispense with the emulator entirely and use a device. Windows Mobile is such a travesty to develop for (with a cumbersome multistep provisioning process to their emulator) and such resultant low... <br />(<a href="http://blog.favrik.com/2010/10/10/modern-development-goodness-for-native-apps/">Read more</a>)

		RhoHub adds iPhone/iPad build capability Hello Smartphone Developers, Today we are proud to announce the ability to perform iOS builds on RhoHub, our hosted service for smartphone app development. Yes, this means that you can now build iPhone and iPad apps right from your Windows or Linux-based computer (and Macs of course). We provide instructions on how to generate certificates and provisioning profiles using OpenSSL instead of XCode. With those in hand you can then build for iPhone with any Rhodes app for which you have posted the source code to RhoHub. We have over ten thousand developers writing apps on RhoHub and many more tens of thousands of downloads. One of the most frequent questions from our customers was “I love writing native smartphone apps with Rhodes on my Windows machine, but how do I build for iPhone”. Of course since Rhodes generates native apps and builds with XCode this (building on Windows) isn’t actually possible with a local copy of Rhodes. But it CAN be done with our hosted service RhoHub. Now RhoHub has Mac servers to enable hosted builds. Note that you will then need to test from a device instead of the emulator. But we see... <br />(<a href="http://blog.favrik.com/2010/09/30/rhohub-adds-iphone-ipad-build-capability/">Read more</a>)

		BlackBerry validates the the “write native apps with web skills” category that Rhodes created
We were excited to read about the BlackBerry WebWorks Application Platform which was released yesterday. It is yet more validation of the “use your web skills to write native smartphone apps” approach that Rhomobile invented two years ago.
For developers that want to target all smartphones (not just BlackBerry), or provide synchronized offline data, or get the power of the Model View Controller pattern (WebWorks and other frameworks do not allow separation of controllers and views) we believe that the existence of such simpler frameworks provides a great steppingstone to Rhodes. <br />(<a href="http://blog.favrik.com/2010/09/28/blackberry-validates-the-write-native-apps-with-web-skills-category-that-rhodes-created/">Read more</a>)
